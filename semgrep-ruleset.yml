# semgrep ruleset: use official Semgrep Registry packs for automated updates
# This file replaces local rules and points to curated packs.
# Keep this file at repository root so semgrep-action picks it up by default.

config:
  - p/ci
  - p/java
  - p/security-audit

# Optional: exclude test directories and generated code
exclude:
  - 'src/test/**'
  - '**/generated/**'

# If you need to add local exceptions later, add them under 'rules' with careful review.
